Computer science is the study of computers, how they work, why they work the way that they do, and how to make them do new things. Some computer scientists may work on hardware which is what computers are made of, others might work on software which is what is used to make programs. These programs solve problems and make our lives easier. Others still will work on computer theory including algorithms, computation, and information. Overall, computer science is just as varied and broad as any other science, but instead of working with the body like in biology, we work with an electronic body called the computer.
