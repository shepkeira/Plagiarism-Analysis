Computer science is the study of computers, what they are made of, how they think, and how we can use them to make our lives easier. The physical part of the computer is called the hardware. Computer scientists that are interested in hardware can either develop parts that make computers faster, or combine parts for other people. The part of the computer that knows what to do is called the software which is what is used to make programs. Computer scientists that are interested in software can create programs that solve problems and make our lives easier. Others work on computer theory like machine learning and algorithms.
