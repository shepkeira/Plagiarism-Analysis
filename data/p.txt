Computer Science is the study of computers, how they work, why they work the way they do, and how to create new programs on computers. People who study computer science often create programs that allow people to do new things on computers. Things that might be created on a computer would be something like a new game, or something to help solve math problems, or something to let people all around the world chat with each other. Almost anything new that is created on the computer is created under the umbrella of computer science.
